# Outliers by Malcolm Gladwe
The book was filled with many intriguing narratives all throughout, making it one of the most interesting reads I’ve had. It tackled factors affecting success very carefully with real-life stories and presented statistics in a way that makes you go “wow, that’s crazy”, every couple pages. It picks on your curiosity as you read it and never fails to hit the mark. From birth dates, cultural legacies, environment, race — it made me feel more acquainted with the idea of “success”. It was never only about being born “gifted”. It wasn’t about spending 10,000 hours on your craft. It wasn’t about being born on a specific day or month. It wasn’t about seeing a vision that nobody else has or being born with a particular skin color. It is a mix of many different factors that vary from person to person — none of which guarantee success on their own but they overlap in one thing: noticing an opportunity, and taking the necessary actions to seize it! Although if you have the things I just mentioned, then you may receive a slightly different set of opportunities that will separate you from the rest like Bill Gates did when he had access to a computer every day in an era where barely anyone has it. Stay lucky!
